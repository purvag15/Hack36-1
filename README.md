    **About the Project -**


    Our project helps the teachers to get students' marks in excel sheet from their handwritten ones with just one click, thereby saving them from long hours of the drudgery of checking and then manually entering marks in the excel sheet one by one. It will save time as well as efforts in this new (online) mode of education.
